I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me

I don't know how you do what you do
But you do it so good to me
My favorite pill when I'm getting so blue
Your taste is all I need

Baby you're my cocaine, I can't stop sniffing
You move so good, got my heart totally tripping
The moment I get you in my veins
I'm taking over the world

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me
Using your black magic on me
Using your black magic on me

You make it so damn good to be bad
You're the best I ever had
You're cold-blooded and I love it

Baby you're my ocean, I can't stop swimming
The salt of your waves, and I can't stop sipping
The moment I get you all alone

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me
Using your black magic on me
Using your black magic on me

When I was young my father warned me
About girls like you
About girls like you
When my heart is numb and I'm feeling lonely
I let you through
And you fixed my blues up

I let you in my brain
I used to doubt, now I believe
I let you ease my pain
Using your black magic on me
Using your black magic on me
Using your black magic on me

I love it, babyï»¿
