These days the lovers trade their places
Dancing all around each other's chairs
I can see the numbness on their faces
Jealousy fills up their hearts in pairs
So please could I be selfish with your body?
'Cause I don't think I could share you with nobody

Oh when I have you
I'm gonna brand you with my lips
And all of the world will know that you're mine now
We'll never lose faith
'Cause we'll never forget this taste
My love has the power to keep the tide down

Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down
Ohh ill get you tied down, tied down

Ohh, late at night you'll hear the screaming echo
But we all pretend we never heard the cries in the daytime
Don't you worry my touch won't leave you hollow
I'm never going to let you change your mind

Oh, when I have you
I'm gonna brand you with my lips
And all of the world will know that you're mine now
We'll never lose faith
'Cause we'll never forget this taste
My love has the power to keep your tied down

Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down
Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down
Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied, ohh
Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down

Don't be afraid to leave your mark
Give me the scars to remind me
Just how good you are (how good you are)
And if your faith turns into to dark
Pull me closer and know
That it's enough to keep you tied down

Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down
Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down
Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down
Ohh, I'll get you tied down, tied down

Tied down
Ohh
